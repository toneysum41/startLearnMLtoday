# startLearnMLtoday
I am working on this project on Windows system. In this case, i use Anaconda python management tooling to setup my developing environment.
Therefore, i suggest anyone who want to learn ML or something about AI on Windows system to setup Anaconda before you start.

### step1
Start to learn the basic nueral network based on a classic book that we could have the basic understand for what is nueral network and how we can build a machine learning model with python.

### step2
Try to find some other nueral network models, to understand their design concept and running theory. For here, i find RNN (LSTM and GRU) 
to try to acheive them by myself. Meanwhile, we should find a 

### step3
After try different neeral network system, i find that there are some key elements which effect the performance of our network, classifier
and activation function. Therefore in this step, we should start to try to research more different classifieres and activation functions

### step4
Start to use the knowledge we known to explore something new in real project. I choose to explore NLP now
